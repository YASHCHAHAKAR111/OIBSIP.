    In this chapter A 10-year-old boy named Nobita Nobi hears a mysterious voice saying that he will hang himself in the <br>
    next 30 minutes and be burned alive in the next 40 minutes. He asks who is speaking, but nobody; suddenly, the drawer<br>
     at his desk opens. He is shocked when a blue robot cat hops out of his desk and eats the rice cake before leaving.<br>
      After a short while, a boy named Sewashi Nobi also comes. They explain that they are from the future and have come <br>
       to save Nobita from a horrible fate. Sewashi tells him about the future and that he will marry Jaiko 15 years later.<br>
        Nobita refuses to talk about this and chases both back. Nobita's mother and father confided in him about the bad dream.<br>
         (Knowing his fate) After that, Shizuka and Jaiko are playing battledore, and the shuttlecock is stuck on Nobita's house roof. </p>
